Finally, edit how to edit the scenario for dinamic scenes. After warp objects to match with projection.


GITHUB ( fork and master branch )
Dude, where's my fork? Each chinos has to make a fork in Github and after
clone it to you git client. So your machine will save u fork. 
When a big change it's clear, we will push it to the master branch from chinos group.
