chinoPinball
============

ChinoPinball it’s a video-mapping pinball game that uses 3d structures as a projection support. Compared to 
other video-mapping games, this project stands out with the possibility of making the projection on 3d 
spaces and not only the usual 2D facades.

ChinoPinball was created as an opensource tool game that can be configured and adapted for anyone. This 
game is designed to be projected in public spaces like streets, squares and buildings or just on a small 
table with some 3D objects.
Ideally you could adapt this game to any context scenario or media content. This can be done with the 3d 
editor and configuration files.

The game interface is basically composed by 3 inputs (sensors): the start game, the right and the left 
lever.

The game rules consist of obtaining as much points as possible by reaching all the different objects and 
missions available.

###Contributing to ChinoPinball

In order to contribute to ChinoPinball the first step is to fork the project. Bellow you can find a small github tutorial on how to do it.
When you have updates that you want to merge in the main repository, make a pull request.

**fork** master branch

Dude, where's my fork? 
Each developer has to fork in his Github ( click on website fork ) 
Then clone it to you git client
```
	>> git clone http://GitHubProjectAdresss
```	
develop your code
add changes to the local repo
```
	>> git add <filename>
	or
	>> git add *
```
upload your changes to your github branch
```
	>> git stage xxx file
	>> git commit -m 'message to the statge files'
	>> git push or git push -u origin master
```
if the local repo is not connected to the remote one
```
	>> git remote add origin <server>
```
update local repository with remote changes
```
	git pull
```
branches
```
	>> git checkout -b <branch> #create new branch
	>> git checkout master #switch to master branch
	>> git branch -d <branch> #delete branch
	>> git push origin <branch> #push branch to remote repository
	
```
merge
```
	git merge <branch>
```
restore file with the last working copy from HEAD
```
	>> git checkout -- <filename>
```
When finally
u wanna merge it, to chinos  master branch 
push from origin to master 	
```
	>> git push -u origin masterChinos
```

To clone all the addons requested by the project you can also execute the ./clone_addons.sh script

Currently developed on MAC (XCode 5.0.2, MAC OS SDK 10.9, LLVM compiler) and Windows (VisualStudio 2012)

The project should also compile in Windows or Linux if ofxSyphone is not used. Just don't add ofxSyphon files to the compilation and comment in *ExternalsConfig.h*  the line *#define USE_SYPHON*:

```

#ifndef chinoPinball_ExternalsConfig_h
#define chinoPinball_ExternalsConfig_h

/* comment define if don't want to use feature */
//#define USE_SYPHON
```
We are using MadMapper for projection mapping http://www.madmapper.com

###ClassHierarchy

![ClassHierarchy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChinosInternationalCC/chinoPinball/master/doc/ClassHierarchy.png)

The main class is **PinballChinoManager**. In this class are defines all the main object: a scenario and a scenario editor, objects that handles inputs and outputs like handling of the keyboard, OSC communication, DMX communication, Arduino communication, objects that handles the sound playback.

###Projection mapping

**Mapping the game on one surface with 3D elements**

* First step is to find or build a physical space for mapping (like a wall or ramp with some 3D elements)
* Second, setup projector and don't touch it later
* Next, in the game, adjust free camera position and FOV according to spectators' point of view (it is not the same as projector's point of view) and fix the camera
* In Madmapper grab video from Syphon and adjust it so that game's perspective fits to the physical space
* Edit scenario using scenario editor to fit the table and objects to physical elements  

**Mappig the game on multiple surfaces with 3D elements**

We don't know how to do this yet ...


***
###Scenario editor

The idea is to be able to create scenario directly on the place where the game will be projected, without prior preparation (only the objects could be prepared earlier).
Then, maybe we could also let the people create scenarios by themselves. 

Editor has the following functionalities:
* saved/load scenario to a file
* change width and height of a table (with walls)
* add new objects
* select object to edit
* edit object's properties:
	* position XY (we can forget about Z for now), the best would be drag&drop
	* scale
	* rotation
	* color
* objects types: lever, hammer, obstacle ...

To enter in the scenario editor mode press the key 'e'

###3DModels

We support almos all the major 3D model file formats by using the AssimpModel Loader. In order to load a model designed in Cinema4D for example you have to copy them in the */bin/data* path and to add a new entry in te *scenario.xml* file.

```
    <object>
        <type>6</type>
        <id>5</id>
        <color>14423100</color>
        <pointsCollision>0</pointsCollision>
        <positionX>0.474898070</positionX>
        <positionY>12.638760567</positionY>
        <positionZ>-0.899999976</positionZ>
        <scaleX>0.100000009</scaleX>
        <scaleY>0.100000009</scaleY>
        <scaleZ>0.100000009</scaleZ>
        <rotationX>-0.541731715</rotationX>
        <rotationY>-0.442292124</rotationY>
        <rotationZ>0.587128937</rotationZ>
        <rotationW>0.407656848</rotationW>
        <path>3DMODELS/new/totem1.obj</path>
    </object>
```
The tag *<type>* should hold the object type; one of the values defined in the *enum shapeType*
```
    enum shapeType{
        ShapeTypeBall = 0,
        ShapeTypeSimpleBox = 1,
        ShapeTypeSpring = 2,
        ShapeTypeLever = 3,
        ShapeTypeContainer = 4,
        ShapeTypeHammer = 5,
        ShapeTypeObstacle = 6,
        ShapeTypeBounds = 7,
        ShapeTypeAnimatedObject = 8,
        ShapeTypeAnimatedMesh = 9,
        ShapeTypeGeneratedMesh = 10,
        ShapeTypeAnimatedMotionPath = 11
    };
```

The tag *<id>* should hold a unique id for each object.

***
###Shape Types

**Hammer** is the object used to launch the ball and it gives to the loaded 3D model a movement like in the image below

![Hammer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChinosInternationalCC/chinoPinball/master/doc/hammer.gif)

**Lever** are the objects used to hit the ball and they give the movement from bellow to the 3D model

![Lever](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChinosInternationalCC/chinoPinball/master/doc/lever.gif)

***
###OSC

All the collision events and other information regarding the game like the curent mission, score etc are sent via OSC in order to be available to other external application like MadMapper, Module8, PureData, MaxMsp, SuperCollider etc

The following OSC addresses are currently implemented

```
/Collision/Object/Id
/Collision/Object/Name
/Collision/Object/Position
/Mission/Event
/Mission/ID
```

Example PureData/collision.pd
![PureData](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChinosInternationalCC/chinoPinball/master/doc/PureData.png)

The OSC implementation can be found in the OSCManager class

###Sound


https://soundcloud.com/alexgeell/chinos-internacional-pinball-raval-song

Chinos Internacional Pinball Song utiliza una base de Rumba en la guitarra como símbolo los gitanos catalanes, una percusión afro india que aporta un ambiente oriental para que las melodías del baglama griego se combinen con el paisaje sonoro del barrio, que da cuenta de personas y actividades que se desarrollan cotidianamente en sus espacios públicos.
